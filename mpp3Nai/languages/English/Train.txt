The station was nearly empty, save for a few weary travelers waiting for the last train of the night. Among them was Sarah, who sat alone on a bench, her suitcase by her side. She glanced at the clock, the hands moving agonizingly slow, each tick echoing in the cavernous hall.​

Sarah's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts. She had left her hometown years ago in search of new opportunities, but now she was returning, uncertain of what awaited her. The familiar chime announced the arrival of the train, and she took a deep breath, steeling herself for the journey ahead.​

As the train sped through the night, Sarah watched the landscape blur past the window. Memories of her childhood flashed before her eyes—the laughter, the tears, the moments that had shaped her. She realized that, despite the years and the distance, home had never truly left her heart.
