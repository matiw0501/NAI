The heat was relentless. The sun hung like a golden coin above the endless dunes, and the camel caravan moved slowly, deliberately, across the landscape. In the midst of it all was Amira, clutching the small satchel that held the last letter from her brother.

He had ventured across this desert years ago in search of the fabled oasis—a place said to offer healing, clarity, and peace. Many called it a myth, but Amira had always believed.

The nights were bitterly cold and filled with stories shared around the fire: tales of lost cities, wandering spirits, and the stars that never lost their way. Amira listened closely, tracing constellations with her finger, wondering if her brother had looked at the same sky.

When they reached a small spring hidden between rocky cliffs, Amira knew the journey had been worth it. Not because she found the oasis, but because in the quiet, she finally heard her brother’s voice in the wind.
