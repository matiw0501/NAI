Hidden beneath the bustling city streets lay a secret known to only a few—the Forgotten Library. This vast repository of knowledge had been abandoned for centuries, its existence fading into myth and legend. Yet, for Alex, a young historian with an insatiable curiosity, the library was more than a tale; it was a mystery waiting to be uncovered.​

After years of research and countless dead ends, Alex finally discovered an old map hinting at the library's location. With a heart pounding in anticipation, he navigated the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the city, each step bringing him closer to his goal.​

When he finally pushed open the heavy wooden doors, Alex was met with a sight that took his breath away.

The air was thick with the scent of old paper and ink, a testament to the knowledge that lay within.​

Alex knew that he had stumbled upon something extraordinary. The Forgotten Library was no longer forgotten, and its secrets were ready to be revealed.
