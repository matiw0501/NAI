Beneath the waves of the southern sea lies a city forgotten by time. Coral-covered towers and streets paved with shell glisten silently, watched only by curious fish and the occasional passing whale.

Marine archaeologist Dr. Theo Ramirez had always dreamed of this place. For decades, it had appeared only in myths and ancient seafaring songs. But sonar scans and lucky currents led him to a reef that shouldn’t exist.

Diving down, he saw it: spires and archways, inscriptions on stones no one had read in a thousand years. Theo swam slowly, reverently, documenting each discovery with care.

But the most haunting moment came when he entered what appeared to be a temple. In its center was a statue—weathered, but clearly human, arms open as if waiting for something. Or someone.

When Theo returned to the surface, the sky was darker than he remembered. He looked back at the sea and wondered: had he discovered the city, or had it discovered him?
