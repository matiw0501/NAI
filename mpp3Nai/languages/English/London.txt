London grew rapidly in the 19th century, becoming the world's largest city at the time. Since the 19th century,[10][11] the name "London" has referred to the metropolis around the City of London, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised the administrative area of Greater London, governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[f][13]
